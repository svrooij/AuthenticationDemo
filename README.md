This project is to show how easy it is to enable JWT authentication on your api, with tokens from Entra ID.

## Codetour available

[![CodeTour badge][badge_codetour]][link_codetour]

This project uses [CodeTour][link_codetour] in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to describe how stuff works. If you want a detailed explaination on how JWT authentication works, I suggest to install this extension and follow the tour.
